Targets will change according to progress in design stages.
For files and programs analysing fins
Repository containing files and programs analysing behaviour of composite fins and foundational models.

Some problems to solve right now (in order of priority):
FLUTTER - finding right material with optimum shear modulus 
  - graphs modelling how changes in altitude and thickness affect the flutter
  - Finding point of highest aerodynamic resistance (i.e. lowest critical flutter velocity)
  - Varying thickness to find point in flight profile that requires the highest shear modulus of the material.
